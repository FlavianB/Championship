# Championship

This project enables its users to manage different tournaments.

# Prerequisites for compiling:

libcurl: sudo apt-get install -y libcurl-dev

SQLite: sudo apt-get install -y libsqlite3-dev

# Compiling:

You need to open a terminal in the directory where Makefile is present and type the command 'make'. I used Makefile to make compiling easier and straight-forward, as multiple source files are present in the project.

The executables will be created in the directory 'build' and the database will be created wherever the executables are run.
